Seeing what the correlation between the amount of greenery in an urban area and the well-being of the population within it.

My goal for the project was to see if there was any correlation between the greenery in cities and the well-being of the population. I chose this since having moved a lot, even across continents, as well as having the opportubity to explore the world through travel, many times I have felt my own happiness falter if there isn't enough greenery around me. The feeling of being trapped in between tall concrete biuldings makes me feel claustrophobic and dejects my mood. This made me wonder, are there other people that feel the same way? There are so many different cities, some intense metrolitan like New York, that has a big park, however, not every urban city has something like this. I think that especially in today's developing urban world it is important to be able to wind down and spend some time amongst nature. This becaomes even more vital for teenagers, some of who, sadly choose to spend their time on electronics rather than being outside. This is why I decided to research this project and see if there was a correlation.
